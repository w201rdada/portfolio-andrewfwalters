This fear of liability that drives investment in hardening of

A good cybersecurity strategy will always be a full stack solution, but a better net keeping threats out of an enterprise environment alieviates some of the risk on the remainder of the system. This isn't a new idea, enterprise network security started with simple firewalls and has evolved to a multi-layered stack providing some measure of protection to the machines behind it. This network security is often software purchased from a third party and configured for the local environment. Some common layers include: blocking unused ports, blacklisting untrustworthy websites, and scanning email attachments for known malicious code.

Codsider that the average enterprise network is not very diverse. Within the network there are one or two computer architectures and a handful of operating systems. This limits the space of all possible malware greatly, and provides an oppertunity to reduce the network security problem to a more manageable size. A general malware detection system provides protection from two many threats to examine every packet for a threat. But given a small enough space of threats it could become possible to search every bit for potential threats.

This is because cybersecurity threats are written for a particular operating system and architecture. Compiled code for that arch/OS combination is identifiable.
