Big Educational Data Abstract Schools have lots of data, but very little is accessible to researchers. This limits the effectiveness of experimenting with educational policy, because it can be hard for experiments to collect enough data or follow through on educational outcomes of students. Creating a way to compile data, especially the troves of qualitative data, that schools collect would allow for much better research. Qualitative data can be processed and mined and produce insights that would be impossible otherwise. Enterprise Cyber Security at Scale Abstract Security software has become very good at finding known threats, but what about unkonwn threats? There are properties that make executable software look different from other forms of network traffic, and malware has common properties that may stand out. So why not build a classifier that searches all network traffic for potential malware? This could prevent malicious software from ever entering an enterprise network.

Teachers are already overwhelmed with data collection, the granularity of data on each student that is required in most school districts causes teachers to burn the midnight oil completing forms instead of planning lessons [1] [2]. While there is are many reason’s to worry about the work-life balance of our nation’s educators, the greater concern is that most of this valuable data disappears into the black hole of the local education district’s servers (or worse, file cabinets). Looking through publicly available datasets, not one contains any qualitative data about students [3]. While there are large datasets available about how schools are performing, this is of limited utility to researchers who want to look at the big picture. Which students had successful outcomes? Which of those students “beat the odds” and outperformed their demographic expectations? What are the educational methods that empower students to out-perform? Those are the questions that could lead to real change in the education space. Finding a way to answer those questions could unlock tremendous value for our country and the world. 1.2 Collecting a Mountain of Data The plan for better educational research requires two actions. The first action is on the part of educators, specifically administrations at the local and state level. Finding a way to unlock the vast troves of qualitative student data is challenging but not insurmountable. There are two major barriers preventing access to this data by researchers: social concerns about privacy, and operational concerns about how this data fits together. The social challenge can be mostly overcome by existing technology. Apple announced the use of differential privacy in the iOS ecosystem to allow the company to perform analytics on user data while protecting privacy [4]. Commitment to a similar technology combined with a public campaign about the benifits could convince most administrators that this is worthwhile. With the blessing of state and local administrators, the opperational hurdle will need to be overcome. Standardized tests and some demographic information currently comprise most of the information collected about individual students at the federal level. Expanding this to qualitative data requires some form a standardization about what data is collected. At a minimum, there needs to be a way to map this data to an individual student as they switch between school districts and states. Following students with many dimensions of data as they progress through school is crucial to understanding the long term effects of education policy. At best, this is an oppertunity for schools to rethink the data they collect, and learning to work smarter not harder. Common data formats and sharing data collection ideas would be a great way for schools to reduce the administrative workload on teachers and instead focus on only collecting just enough data to accurately track students. Having completed the data collection component, releasing the data to researchers should be sufficient to yeild breakthoughs in policy. For example, instead of finding a school to implement policy X, a reasearcher could simply take a random sample of schools that have implemented policy X compared to a random control group and test their hypotheses. Unleashing techniques like natural langage processsing would yeild deeper insights about student outcomes then just test scores would ever be able to. This will bring about meaningful policy changes that are backed by reliable data and tested at scale. 1.3 A National Call to Action While the education space is not known for leading the way in technology, there is a real possibility that administrators could see the value in better educational research. For example, years after most every office worker had a computer, schools started experimenting with chromebooks and iPads for students. This demonstrates that administrators do have an interest in adopting succesful technology, but are cautious about taking on any risk in their already tight budget. Data science is now at a stage where it has shown to deliver value to companies accross industries. Educators should now start to realize that there is very little risk in turning to data analytics, and it may give them insights into thieir pressing questions like “Are those chromebooks I just bought actually helping my students?” 1.4 References NPR.

A problem that is always at the back of their mind but is never truly urgent until it breaks. Constant news of enterprise data breaches reinforce the fear, and companies invest just enough to give their leadership a sense of security. The complexity of cyber threats makes it difficult to assess exactly how much time and capital is the right amount to invest. Even the best layered security system could be brought down by a poorly written piece of software. 2.2 Better Way Through Data Science While a good cybersecurity strategy will always be a full stack solution, most layers (particularly those closest to the hardware) often rely on deterministic means to provide security. A virus scan program might store hashes of known malware, an automated administrator applies the latest security patches, or a firewall prevents access to a network on all but a few ports. While good strategies, these deterministic systems depend on human judgement that is often not reevaluated frequently. There is an opportunity for an umbrella layer of cybersecurity to protect entire systems, a layer that can learn and adapt to new attacks. Better yet, if this layer could protect against zero-day vulnerabilities in would be invaluable. By looking at all traffic passing through an enterprise network, some content could be flagged as potentially malicious and stopped before it touches a vulnerable system. Consider what a computer virus might look like. A virus will contain either source code or compiled code, it will target a handful of parts of the system, and it will attempt to spread itself. Those are clear patterns that could be learned by a model trained on a large set of malware. 2.3 A Business Imperative The enterprise market for this dynamic cybersecurity umbrella is enormous. In conjunction with existing security techniques, it would make existing enterprises far more resilient to attacks by blocking malicious traffic before it reaches the corporate intranet. IT professionals would be foolish not to incorporate this layer into their overall security strategy. 2.4 First Headline Attempt Enterprises safe fom malware using network scanning: CEO still writes passwords on sticky notes 2.5 Summarized Peer Feedback Throwing Money at the Problem - Add supporting evidence (Charlene) - Unclear if enterprise is spending too much or too little (Simon) Better Way Through Data Science - Make technical explanation more concise (Akhil and Charlene) - Add a better description of what machine code means and how data science would be applied (Akhil) A Business Imperative - How does this scale up, or is it always an enterprise-specific solution?
