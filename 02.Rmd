## Big Data, Small Data

The US educational system has a two-fold problem with data. Teachers are already overwhelmed with data collection, the granularity of data on each student that is required in most school districts causes teachers to burn the midnight oil completeing forms instead of planning lessons [[1](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/04/485838588/after-25-years-this-teacher-says-its-all-the-paperwork-that-made-him-quit)][2]()
educators are lousy at data collection. Hard to prove what situations call for which methods because of biased data

## A middle.

Common data collection format over years will give researchers a great repository to draw repeatable conclusions from. Would need to document all educational models in play at each school.

## An end.

Privacy concerns, would it be possible to extract personal data from this set. Will this actually resolve any disputes .
